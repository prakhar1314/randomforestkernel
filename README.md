# The Random Forest Kernel
The commonly used kernels are usually unsupervised.
Though having proven their worth, they usually donâ€™t adapt to
the underlying statistics of the data. We have a wide range of
known kernel methods, as the Linear kernel, Periodic kernel,
Radial Basis function (RBF) and Polynomial to mention some
of them. The most popular kernel is the RBF kernel, and it is
often presented as the default kernel.

In this project, we describe a supervised kernel method called
the Random Forest Kernel. We showed how we can sample
random partitions from the dataset using an implementation
of the Random Forest.
